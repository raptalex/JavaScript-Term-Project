<h2>Candle Chaser</h2>
<!--<p id="box">A game that revolves around the player walking to candles to blow them all out.
The color of the flame on the candle determines how many times the player needs to walk over it to blow it out.
The player will be chased by a ghost that will attempt to relight the candles, if the player is touched by the ghost they lose the game.
The ghost will be destroyed once the player blows out a random candle that lights up when the ghost is spawned.
