Find it! v0.2

Click on one of the boxes with a question mark to see if you can get lucky enough to win the game. You are given a limited number of tries to find the correct box.

The purpose of this game is to be a simple guessing game with no bells or whistles, I also wanted to experiment with the "data" custom attribute used in HTML tags.
The game doesn't have a good way of preventing two boxes from being "winning" boxes when it should just be one.

I plan to resolve this issue by implementing code that makes sure there is only one box that causes the win condition.
The game also cannot be replayed without reloading the page, I am going to keep it this way.
I also plan on possibly making a future release that makes the boxes more animated and adds more boxes.
