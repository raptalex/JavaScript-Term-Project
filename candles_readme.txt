Candles v0.1

Move the player with the mouse or touchpad and collect all of the candles to win.
A ghost will spawn after some time, make sure not to get caught by it or your will lose the game.

This game is supposed to be something more "video game" like than the other games which are more akin to
traditional games. I wanted to use images for graphics and also have an "enemy" that chases you.

Right now the game has only a couple issues. One of these issues is that the ghost chasing code has a problem that
makes the ghost chase the player in slower increments the closer it is to the player.
I plan on fixing this by seeing why this is happening or reimplementing the ghost chase code to use the distance formula in a different way.

For future releases, I would like to make this game closer to my original vision by reworking it to have the player blowing out candles instead of collecting them.
I would also like to add more colors for the candle's flames that correspond to how many times the player needs to blow out the candle by moving over it.
