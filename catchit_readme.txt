Click on one of the boxes with a question mark to see if you can get lucky enough to win the game. You are given a limited number of tries to find the correct box.

The purpose of this game is to be a simple guessing game with no bells or whistles.
The game doesn't have a good way of preventing two boxes from being "winning" boxes when it should just be one.
I plan to resolve this issue by implementing code that makes sure there is only one box that causes the win condition.
I also plan on possibly making a future release that makes the boxes more animated.
