A game where you have to click on a certain object randomly placed in a certain area in the canvas/viewport in a certain amount of time determined by a timer. The player will be given a certain amount of lives, every time the player fails to click on the object in time they lose a life. If the player clicks on a part of the screen that isn't the object they will lose a certain amount of time from the timer. The amount of time is randomly selected each round.
